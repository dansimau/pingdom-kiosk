== Installing ==
Pingdom Kiosk requires node.js, available at http://nodejs.org/download/ or via
your distributors software channels.

Additional node.js dependencies are required to run Pingdom Kiosk. At the time
of writing they are:
buffer-crc32
bytes
connect
cookie
cookie-signature
debug
express
fresh
jade
methods
pause
range-parser
send
socket.io
socket.io-client

You will also need to copy node-launcher from contrib/ into /usr/local/bin/,
either link or install node to /usr/local/bin/ and put Pingdom Kiosk in
/opt/pingdom-kiosk if you want to avoid making any manual changes to the init
script.

== Configuration ==
The configuration file must be added at [pingdom kiosk root]/kiosk-server.conf.
An example file called kiosk-server.conf.dist is provided in this package.
name, username, password and app_key are required, exclude[] and include[] are
both optional.

include[] and exclude[] are comma separated entries which can be spread over
multiple lines. Eg:
				"include": [],
				"exclude": [
				serverone,
				servertwo,
				serverthree
				]

== Running ==
Below is an example run of pingdom kiosk outside the init script.

sudo ./contrib/node-launcher --no-detach --pidfile=/var/run/pingdom-kiosk.pid --logfile=/var/log/pingdom-kiosk.log /usr/local/bin/node ./pingdom-kiosk.js

Running with the init script should be as easy as
sudo ./contrib/init start

The kiosk will start on http://0.0.0.0:3000 by default so should be easily accessible at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
